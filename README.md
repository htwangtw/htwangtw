### Hi there I am Hao-Ting ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc researcher of [laboratory for brain simulation and exploration (SIMEXP)](https://github.com/SIMEXP) at CRIUGM, Montreal, Canada. 
My current research focuses on brain connectivity-based biomarker discovery through machine learning. 
I also work on improving data infrastructure and software engineering in neuroimaging research. 
My open source contribution includes, but not limited to: 
neuroscience and machine learning software [Nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn),
[cca-zoo](https://github.com/jameschapman19/cca_zoo/), 
and the [nipy community](https://github.com/nipy), 
especially [nibabel](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel) and [pydra](https://github.com/nipype/pydra). 

You can also find me at [brainhack](https://brainhack.org/) events. 
I recently organised one with friends: [OHBM Brainhack 2022](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/).
I am also an instructor at [Brainhack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/).
