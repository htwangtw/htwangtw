### Hi there I am Hao-Ting ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc researcher of [laboratory for brain simulation and exploration (SIMEXP)](https://github.com/SIMEXP) at CRIUGM, Montreal, Canada. My current research focuses on brain connectivity-based biomarker discovery through machine learning. I am passionate about data infrastructure and software engineering in scientific research. My open source contribution includes, but not limited to: neuroscience and machine learning software [Nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn), [cca-zoo](https://github.com/jameschapman19/cca_zoo/), and [pydra](https://github.com/nipype/pydra) workflow task [pydra-fsl](https://github.com/nipype/pydra-fsl). You can also find me at [brainhack](https://brainhack.org/) events.
